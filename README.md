# ML-Projects

Artificial Neural Net - Implemented my own simple neural network to classify the XOR dataset

Music Generation - Used a dataset of Irish folk songs to build an LSTM network that can generate it's own music

UVA Landmark Detection - Used 2 pre-trained models and built my own convolutional neural network to train and detect buildings across UVA campus
